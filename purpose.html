        <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Making an itinerary for a trip or vacation can take an extensive amount of time, 
            and the alternative of paying someone else to create one for you can be costly. 
            When considering possible ideas for what we could create, we realized that automating 
            the process of making a travel itinerary could be greatly useful and could reduce the 
            stress of planning for a vacation, which is meant to alleviate stress. This is why we 
            created MyTinerary, an automated itinerary generator. Vacationers can spend less time 
            worrying about making their itinerary and more time enjoying their trip, in addition to
            discovering the best local activities and sites in the community they are in.

        <h2>Future Plans and Improvements</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Currently, MyTinerary has a long way to go until it could be considered "done". If we develop
            our skills in the tools used, we could add more detail and improve the personalization
            of our generated itinerary. We could also implement a database of a wider range of places
            to improve the quality of itineraries. These suggestions are just a small fraction
            of the potential that MyTinerary has to help provide the best vacation experiences to users.
