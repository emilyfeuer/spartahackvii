        <h3>Hi! We are a group of sophomores at Michigan State University, all majoring in 
            computer science. Although our interests range from game development to entrepreneurship 
            and innovation, we all love to travel, and hope you enjoy MyTinerary!

        <h2>What We've Learned</h2>
        <br>
        <h3> In the process of working on MyTinerary, we have been learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            We combined these tools to create and style web pages and integrate the form the user filled out with our 
            itinerary generation. None of us knew very much about any of these tools, but we have learned a lot through 
            trying them out during SpartaHack.
